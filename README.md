# HoneYLoG
Shitty honeypot repo; Made by my friend Amp ([@LulzAmp](https://github.com/LulzAmp)) and originally found on LulzSec's website; 
**Warning:** actually, really shitty. I tried to start it off as a small logger, it got out of hands. Might add E-Mail Support soon (if I get bored again).


1. Configure htaccess.txt (set your full path to .htpassword)
2. Rename htaccess.txt to .htaccess; Rename htpasswd.txt to .htpasswd
3. Configure CloudFlare (at the top of index.php)
4. Configure Users (honeylog.php: line 13; use [PASSWORD_BCRYPT](https://bcrypt-generator.com) to hash your passwords.)
4. You're done; have fun.

Optional: 6. remove the following part of code from .htaccess and remove .htpasswd completely, so dumbasses won't give up on the login.
```apacheconf
# setup htpasswd
AuthUserFile /full/path/to/.htpasswd
AuthType Basic
# put whatever bullshit you want here instead of "Restricted Area"
AuthName "Restricted Area"
Require valid-user
```

> .htpassword contains **root:toor**, **admin:admin**, **Admin:admin**, **'or 1=1 /\*:'or 1=1 /*** & **'OR 1=1 /\*:'OR 1=1 /*** by default.
